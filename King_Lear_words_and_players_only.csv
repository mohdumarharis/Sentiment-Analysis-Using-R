"Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me","LEAR"

"  Come, my fair Cordelia.","FRANCE"

"  That's most certain, and with you; next month","REGAN"
"with us.","REGAN"
"  You see how full of changes his age is; the","GONERIL"
"observation we have made of it hath not been","GONERIL"
"little. He always loved our sister most, and with","GONERIL"
"what poor judgment he hath now cast her off","GONERIL"
"appears too grossly.","GONERIL"
"  'Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever","REGAN"
"but slenderly known himself.","REGAN"
"  The best and soundest of his time hath been","GONERIL"
"but rash. Then must we look from his age to","GONERIL"
"receive not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed","GONERIL"
"condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness","GONERIL"
"that infirm and choleric years bring with","GONERIL"
"them.","GONERIL"
"  Such unconstant starts are we like to have","REGAN"
"from him as this of Kent's banishment.","REGAN"

"between France and him. Pray you, let us sit","GONERIL"
"together. If our father carry authority with such","GONERIL"

"   This policy and reverence of age","GLOUCESTER"

"in?--When came you to this? Who brought it?","GLOUCESTER"
"  It was not brought me, my lord; there's the","EDMUND"
"cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement","EDMUND"

"  Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft","EDMUND"
"maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and","EDMUND"
"fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the","EDMUND"

"  O villain, villain! His very opinion in the","GLOUCESTER"

"without any further delay than this very evening.","EDMUND"
"  He cannot be such a monster.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Nor is not, sure.","EDMUND"
"  To his father, that so tenderly and entirely","GLOUCESTER"
"loves him! Heaven and Earth! Edmund, seek him","GLOUCESTER"
"out; wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the","GLOUCESTER"
"business after your own wisdom. I would unstate","GLOUCESTER"
"myself to be in a due resolution.","GLOUCESTER"

"  These late eclipses in the sun and moon","GLOUCESTER"
"portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of","GLOUCESTER"
"nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds","GLOUCESTER"
"itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,","GLOUCESTER"
"friendship falls off, brothers divide; in cities, mutinies;","GLOUCESTER"
"in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and","GLOUCESTER"
"the bond cracked 'twixt son and father. This villain","GLOUCESTER"
"of mine comes under the prediction: there's son","GLOUCESTER"
"against father. The King falls from bias of nature:","GLOUCESTER"
"there's father against child. We have seen the best of","GLOUCESTER"
"our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and","GLOUCESTER"
"all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our","GLOUCESTER"
"graves.--Find out this villain, Edmund. It shall","GLOUCESTER"
"lose thee nothing. Do it carefully.--And the noble","GLOUCESTER"
"and true-hearted Kent banished! His offense, honesty!","GLOUCESTER"
"'Tis strange.	","GLOUCESTER"
"  This is the excellent foppery of the world, that","EDMUND"
"when we are sick in fortune (often the surfeits of","EDMUND"
"our own behavior) we make guilty of our disasters","EDMUND"
"the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains","EDMUND"
"on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves,","EDMUND"
"thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;","EDMUND"
"drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced","EDMUND"
"obedience of planetary influence; and all that we","EDMUND"
"are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable","EDMUND"
"evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish","EDMUND"
"disposition on the charge of a star! My father","EDMUND"
"compounded with my mother under the Dragon's","EDMUND"
"tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it","EDMUND"
"follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should","EDMUND"
"have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the","EDMUND"
"firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--","EDMUND"
"and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old","EDMUND"
"comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a","EDMUND"
"sigh like Tom o' Bedlam.--O, these eclipses do","EDMUND"
"portend these divisions. Fa, sol, la, mi.","EDMUND"
"  How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation","EDGAR"
"are you in?","EDGAR"

"  Do you busy yourself with that?","EDGAR"
"  I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed","EDMUND"
"unhappily, as of unnaturalness between the","EDMUND"
"child and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of","EDMUND"
"ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and","EDMUND"
"maledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences,","EDMUND"
"banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,","EDMUND"

"  How long have you been a sectary","EDGAR"

"  Come, come, when saw you my father last?","EDMUND"
"  The night gone by.","EDGAR"

"  Ay, two hours together.","EDGAR"
"  Parted you in good terms? Found you no","EDMUND"

"  Armed, brother?","EDGAR"
"  Brother, I advise you to the best. I am no","EDMUND"

"  I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a","KENT"

"  All thy other titles thou hast given away. That","FOOL"

"an egg, and I'll give thee two crowns.","FOOL"
"  What two crowns shall they be?","LEAR"
"  Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat","FOOL"
"up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou","FOOL"
"clovest thy crown i' th' middle and gav'st away","FOOL"
"both parts, thou bor'st thine ass on thy back o'er","FOOL"
"the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown","FOOL"

"  When were you wont to be so full of songs,","LEAR"

"the rod and put'st down thine own breeches,","FOOL"
"	Then they for sudden joy did weep,","FOOL"
"	   And I for sorrow sung,","FOOL"
"	That such a king should play bo-peep","FOOL"
"	   And go the fools among.","FOOL"
"Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach","FOOL"
"thy Fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie.","FOOL"
"  An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.","LEAR"
"  I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.","FOOL"
"They'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou 'lt","FOOL"
"have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am","FOOL"
"whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any","FOOL"
"kind o' thing than a Fool. And yet I would not be","FOOL"
"thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides","FOOL"

"How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on?","LEAR"
"Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.","LEAR"
"  Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no","FOOL"

"In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,","GONERIL"
"I had thought by making this well known unto you","GONERIL"
"To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,","GONERIL"
"By what yourself too late have spoke and done,","GONERIL"
"That you protect this course and put it on","GONERIL"
"By your allowance; which if you should, the fault","GONERIL"
"Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep","GONERIL"
"Which in the tender of a wholesome weal","GONERIL"
"Might in their working do you that offense,","GONERIL"
"Which else were shame, that then necessity","GONERIL"

"  For you know, nuncle,","FOOL"
"	The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,","FOOL"
"	That it's had it head bit off by it young.","FOOL"
"So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.","FOOL"
"  Are you our daughter?","LEAR"
"I would you would make use of your good wisdom,","GONERIL"
"Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away","GONERIL"
"These dispositions which of late transport you","GONERIL"

"Either his notion weakens, his discernings","LEAR"
"Are lethargied--Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so.","LEAR"
"Who is it that can tell me who I am?","LEAR"

"I would learn that, for, by the marks of","LEAR"

"Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires,","GONERIL"
"Men so disordered, so debauched and bold,","GONERIL"
"That this our court, infected with their manners,","GONERIL"
"Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust","GONERIL"

"  Save thee, Curan.","EDMUND"
"  And you, sir. I have been with your father and","CURAN"
"given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and","CURAN"
"Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.","CURAN"
"  How comes that?","EDMUND"
"  Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news","CURAN"
"abroad?--I mean the whispered ones, for they are","CURAN"
"yet but ear-kissing arguments.","CURAN"
"  Not I. Pray you, what are they?","EDMUND"
"  Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt","CURAN"
"the dukes of Cornwall and Albany?","CURAN"
"  Not a word.","EDMUND"
"  You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.","CURAN"
"The Duke be here tonight? The better, best.","EDMUND"
"This weaves itself perforce into my business.","EDMUND"
"My father hath set guard to take my brother,","EDMUND"
"And I have one thing of a queasy question","EDMUND"
"Which I must act. Briefness and fortune work!--","EDMUND"
"Brother, a word. Descend. Brother, I say!","EDMUND"
"My father watches. O sir, fly this place!","EDMUND"
"Intelligence is given where you are hid.","EDMUND"
"You have now the good advantage of the night.","EDMUND"
"Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?","EDMUND"
"He's coming hither, now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,","EDMUND"
"And Regan with him. Have you nothing said","EDMUND"
"Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?","EDMUND"
"Advise yourself.","EDMUND"
"  I am sure on 't, not a word.","EDGAR"
"I hear my father coming. Pardon me.","EDMUND"
"In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.","EDMUND"
"Draw. Seem to defend yourself. Now, quit you","EDMUND"
"well.	","EDMUND"
"Yield! Come before my father! Light, hoa, here!","EDMUND"
" Fly, brother.--Torches, torches!","EDMUND"
"--So, farewell.	","EDMUND"
"Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion","EDMUND"
"Of my more fierce endeavor. I have seen drunkards","EDMUND"
"Do more than this in sport.	","EDMUND"
"Father, father!","EDMUND"
"Stop, stop! No help?","EDMUND"
"  Now, Edmund, where's the","GLOUCESTER"
"villain?","GLOUCESTER"
"Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,","EDMUND"
"Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon","EDMUND"
"To stand auspicious mistress.","EDMUND"
"  But where is he?","GLOUCESTER"
"Look, sir, I bleed.","EDMUND"
"  Where is the villain,","GLOUCESTER"
"Edmund?","GLOUCESTER"
"Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could--","EDMUND"
"Pursue him, ho! Go after.  By no","GLOUCESTER"
"means what?","GLOUCESTER"
"Persuade me to the murder of your Lordship,","EDMUND"
"But that I told him the revenging gods","EDMUND"
"'Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend,","EDMUND"
"Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond","EDMUND"
"The child was bound to th' father--sir, in fine,","EDMUND"
"Seeing how loathly opposite I stood","EDMUND"
"To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion","EDMUND"
"With his prepared sword he charges home","EDMUND"
"My unprovided body, lanced mine arm;","EDMUND"
"And when he saw my best alarumed spirits,","EDMUND"
"Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to th' encounter,","EDMUND"
"Or whether ghasted by the noise I made,","EDMUND"
"Full suddenly he fled.","EDMUND"
"  Let him fly far!","GLOUCESTER"
"Not in this land shall he remain uncaught,","GLOUCESTER"
"And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,","GLOUCESTER"
"My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.","GLOUCESTER"
"By his authority I will proclaim it","GLOUCESTER"
"That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,","GLOUCESTER"
"Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;","GLOUCESTER"
"He that conceals him, death.","GLOUCESTER"
"When I dissuaded him from his intent","EDMUND"
"And found him pight to do it, with curst speech","EDMUND"
"I threatened to discover him. He replied","EDMUND"
"Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faithed? No. What I should
deny--
As this I would, though thou didst produce
My very character--I'd turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice.
And thou must make a dullard of the world
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.","EDMUND"
"  O strange and fastened villain!","GLOUCESTER"
"Would he deny his letter, said he?","GLOUCESTER"
"I never got him.	","GLOUCESTER"
"Hark, the Duke's trumpets. I know not why he","GLOUCESTER"
"comes.","GLOUCESTER"
"All ports I'll bar. The villain shall not 'scape.","GLOUCESTER"
"The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture","GLOUCESTER"
"I will send far and near, that all the kingdom","GLOUCESTER"
"May have due note of him. And of my land,","GLOUCESTER"
"Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means","GLOUCESTER"
"To make thee capable.","GLOUCESTER"
"How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither,","CORNWALL"
"Which I can call but now, I have heard strange","CORNWALL"
"news.","CORNWALL"
"If it be true, all vengeance comes too short","REGAN"
"Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my","REGAN"
"lord?","REGAN"
"O madam, my old heart is cracked; it's cracked.","GLOUCESTER"
"What, did my father's godson seek your life?","REGAN"
"He whom my father named, your Edgar?","REGAN"
"O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!","GLOUCESTER"
"Was he not companion with the riotous knights","REGAN"
"That tended upon my father?","REGAN"
"I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad.","GLOUCESTER"
"Yes, madam, he was of that consort.","EDMUND"
"No marvel, then, though he were ill affected.","REGAN"
"'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,","REGAN"
"To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.","REGAN"
"I have this present evening from my sister","REGAN"
"Been well informed of them, and with such cautions","REGAN"
"That if they come to sojourn at my house","REGAN"
"I'll not be there.","REGAN"
"  Nor I, assure thee, Regan.--","CORNWALL"
"Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father","CORNWALL"
"A childlike office.","CORNWALL"
"  It was my duty, sir.","EDMUND"
"He did bewray his practice, and received","GLOUCESTER"
"This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Is he pursued?","CORNWALL"
"  Ay, my good lord.","GLOUCESTER"
"If he be taken, he shall never more","CORNWALL"
"Be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose,","CORNWALL"
"How in my strength you please.--For you, Edmund,","CORNWALL"
"Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant","CORNWALL"
"So much commend itself, you shall be ours.","CORNWALL"
"Natures of such deep trust we shall much need.","CORNWALL"
"You we first seize on.","CORNWALL"
"  I shall serve you, sir,","EDMUND"
"Truly, however else.","EDMUND"
"  For him I thank your Grace.","GLOUCESTER"
"You know not why we came to visit you--","CORNWALL"
"Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.","REGAN"
"Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,","REGAN"
"Wherein we must have use of your advice.","REGAN"
"Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,","REGAN"
"Of differences, which I best thought it fit","REGAN"
"To answer from our home. The several messengers","REGAN"
"From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,","REGAN"
"Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow","REGAN"
"Your needful counsel to our businesses,","REGAN"
"Which craves the instant use.","REGAN"
"  I serve you, madam.","GLOUCESTER"
"Your Graces are right welcome.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this","OSWALD"
"house?","OSWALD"
"  Ay.","KENT"
"  Where may we set our horses?","OSWALD"
"  I' th' mire.","KENT"
"  Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.","OSWALD"
"  I love thee not.","KENT"
"  Why then, I care not for thee.","OSWALD"
"  If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make","KENT"
"thee care for me.","KENT"
"  Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.","OSWALD"
"  Fellow, I know thee.","KENT"
"  What dost thou know me for?","OSWALD"
"  A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a","KENT"
"base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,","KENT"
"filthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered,","KENT"
"action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable,","KENT"
"finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting","KENT"
"slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good","KENT"
"service, and art nothing but the composition of a","KENT"
"knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir","KENT"
"of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into","KENT"
"clamorous whining if thou deny'st the least syllable","KENT"
"of thy addition.","KENT"
"  Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou thus","OSWALD"
"to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor","OSWALD"
"knows thee!","OSWALD"
"  What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou","KENT"
"knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up","KENT"
"thy heels and beat thee before the King? ","KENT"
" Draw, you rogue, for though it be night,","KENT"
"yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th' moonshine","KENT"
"of you, you whoreson, cullionly barbermonger.","KENT"
"Draw!","KENT"
"  Away! I have nothing to do with thee.","OSWALD"
"  Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against","KENT"
"the King and take Vanity the puppet's part against","KENT"
"the royalty of her father. Draw, you rogue, or I'll so","KENT"
"carbonado your shanks! Draw, you rascal! Come","KENT"
"your ways.","KENT"
"  Help, ho! Murder! Help!","OSWALD"
"  Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat","KENT"
"slave! Strike!	","KENT"
"  Help, ho! Murder, murder!","OSWALD"
"  How now, what's the matter? Part!","EDMUND"
"  With you, goodman boy, if you please. Come, I'll","KENT"
"flesh you. Come on, young master.","KENT"
"Weapons? Arms? What's the matter here?","GLOUCESTER"
"  Keep peace, upon your lives! He dies that","CORNWALL"
"strikes again. What is the matter?","CORNWALL"
"The messengers from our sister and the King.","REGAN"
"  What is your difference? Speak.","CORNWALL"
"  I am scarce in breath, my lord.","OSWALD"
"  No marvel, you have so bestirred your valor.","KENT"
"You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a","KENT"
"tailor made thee.","KENT"
"  Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a","CORNWALL"
"man?","CORNWALL"
"  A tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not","KENT"
"have made him so ill, though they had been but two","KENT"
"years o' th' trade.","KENT"
"  Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?","CORNWALL"
"  This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have","OSWALD"
"spared at suit of his gray beard--","OSWALD"
"  Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter!","KENT"
"--My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread","KENT"
"this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall","KENT"
"of a jakes with him.--Spare my gray beard, you","KENT"
"wagtail?","KENT"
"  Peace, sirrah!","CORNWALL"
"You beastly knave, know you no reverence?","CORNWALL"
"Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.","KENT"
"  Why art thou angry?","CORNWALL"
"That such a slave as this should wear a sword,","KENT"
"Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as","KENT"
"these,","KENT"
"Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain","KENT"
"Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every","KENT"
"passion","KENT"
"That in the natures of their lords rebel--","KENT"
"Being oil to fire, snow to the colder moods--","KENT"
"Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks","KENT"
"With every gale and vary of their masters,","KENT"
"Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.--","KENT"
"A plague upon your epileptic visage!","KENT"
"Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?","KENT"
"Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,","KENT"
"I'd drive you cackling home to Camelot.","KENT"
"  What, art thou mad, old fellow?","CORNWALL"
"  How fell you out? Say that.","GLOUCESTER"
"No contraries hold more antipathy","KENT"
"Than I and such a knave.","KENT"
"Why dost thou call him ""knave""? What is his fault?","CORNWALL"
"  His countenance likes me not.","KENT"
"No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.","CORNWALL"
"Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:","KENT"
"I have seen better faces in my time","KENT"
"Than stands on any shoulder that I see","KENT"
"Before me at this instant.","KENT"
"  This is some fellow","CORNWALL"
"Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect","CORNWALL"
"A saucy roughness and constrains the garb","CORNWALL"
"Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he.","CORNWALL"
"An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!","CORNWALL"
"An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.","CORNWALL"
"These kind of knaves I know, which in this","CORNWALL"
"plainness","CORNWALL"
"Harbor more craft and more corrupter ends","CORNWALL"
"Than twenty silly-ducking observants","CORNWALL"
"That stretch their duties nicely.","CORNWALL"
"Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,","KENT"
"Under th' allowance of your great aspect,","KENT"
"Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire","KENT"
"On flick'ring Phoebus' front--","KENT"
"  What mean'st by this?","CORNWALL"
"  To go out of my dialect, which you discommend","KENT"
"so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that","KENT"
"beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave,","KENT"
"which for my part I will not be, though I should","KENT"
"win your displeasure to entreat me to 't.","KENT"
",   What was th' offense you gave","CORNWALL"
"him?","CORNWALL"
"  I never gave him any.","OSWALD"
"It pleased the King his master very late","OSWALD"
"To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;","OSWALD"
"When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,","OSWALD"
"Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,","OSWALD"
"And put upon him such a deal of man","OSWALD"
"That worthied him, got praises of the King","OSWALD"
"For him attempting who was self-subdued;","OSWALD"
"And in the fleshment of this dread exploit,","OSWALD"
"Drew on me here again.","OSWALD"
"  None of these rogues and cowards","KENT"
"But Ajax is their fool.","KENT"
"  Fetch forth the stocks.--","CORNWALL"
"You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,","CORNWALL"
"We'll teach you.","CORNWALL"
"  Sir, I am too old to learn.","KENT"
"Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King,","KENT"
"On whose employment I was sent to you.","KENT"
"You shall do small respect, show too bold","KENT"
"malice","KENT"
"Against the grace and person of my master,","KENT"
"Stocking his messenger.","KENT"
"Fetch forth the stocks.--As I have life and honor,","CORNWALL"
"There shall he sit till noon.","CORNWALL"
"Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night, too.","REGAN"
"Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,","KENT"
"You should not use me so.","KENT"
"  Sir, being his knave, I will.","REGAN"
"This is a fellow of the selfsame color","CORNWALL"
"Our sister speaks of.--Come, bring away the stocks.","CORNWALL"
"Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.","GLOUCESTER"
"His fault is much, and the good king his master","GLOUCESTER"
"Will check him for 't. Your purposed low correction","GLOUCESTER"
"Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches","GLOUCESTER"
"For pilf'rings and most common trespasses","GLOUCESTER"
"Are punished with. The King must take it ill","GLOUCESTER"
"That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,","GLOUCESTER"
"Should have him thus restrained.","GLOUCESTER"
"  I'll answer that.","CORNWALL"
"My sister may receive it much more worse","REGAN"
"To have her gentleman abused, assaulted","REGAN"
"For following her affairs.--Put in his legs.","REGAN"
"  Come, my good lord, away.","CORNWALL"
"I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's","GLOUCESTER"
"pleasure,","GLOUCESTER"
"Whose disposition all the world well knows","GLOUCESTER"
"Will not be rubbed nor stopped. I'll entreat for thee.","GLOUCESTER"
"Pray, do not, sir. I have watched and traveled hard.","KENT"
"Some time I shall sleep out; the rest I'll whistle.","KENT"
"A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.","KENT"
"Give you good morrow.","KENT"
"The Duke's to blame in this. 'Twill be ill taken.","GLOUCESTER"
"Good king, that must approve the common saw,","KENT"
"Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st","KENT"
"To the warm sun.	","KENT"
"Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,","KENT"
"That by thy comfortable beams I may","KENT"
"Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles","KENT"
"But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,","KENT"
"Who hath most fortunately been informed","KENT"
"Of my obscured course, and shall find time","KENT"
"From this enormous state, seeking to give","KENT"
"Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatched,","KENT"
"Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold","KENT"
"This shameful lodging.","KENT"
"Fortune, good night. Smile once more; turn thy","KENT"

"  I heard myself proclaimed,","EDGAR"
"And by the happy hollow of a tree","EDGAR"
"Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place","EDGAR"

"I will preserve myself, and am bethought","EDGAR"
"To take the basest and most poorest shape","EDGAR"
"That ever penury in contempt of man","EDGAR"
"Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,","EDGAR"
"Blanket my loins, elf all my hairs in knots,","EDGAR"
"And with presented nakedness outface","EDGAR"
"The winds and persecutions of the sky.","EDGAR"
"The country gives me proof and precedent","EDGAR"
"Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices","EDGAR"
"Strike in their numbed and mortified arms","EDGAR"
"Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary,","EDGAR"
"And, with this horrible object, from low farms,","EDGAR"
"Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,","EDGAR"
"Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,","EDGAR"
"Enforce their charity. ""Poor Turlygod! Poor Tom!""","EDGAR"

"  Good morrow to you both.","LEAR"
"  Hail to your Grace.","CORNWALL"
"  I am glad to see your Highness.","REGAN"
"Regan, I think you are. I know what reason","LEAR"
"I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,","LEAR"
"I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,","LEAR"
"Sepulch'ring an adult'ress.  O, are you","LEAR"
"free?","LEAR"
"Some other time for that.--Beloved Regan,","LEAR"
"Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied","LEAR"
"Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.","LEAR"
"I can scarce speak to thee. Thou 'lt not believe","LEAR"
"With how depraved a quality--O Regan!","LEAR"
"I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope","REGAN"
"You less know how to value her desert","REGAN"
"Than she to scant her duty.","REGAN"
"  Say? How is that?","LEAR"
"I cannot think my sister in the least","REGAN"
"Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance","REGAN"
"She have restrained the riots of your followers,","REGAN"
"'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end","REGAN"
"As clears her from all blame.","REGAN"
"  My curses on her.","LEAR"
"  O sir, you are old.","REGAN"
"Nature in you stands on the very verge","REGAN"
"Of his confine. You should be ruled and led","REGAN"
"By some discretion that discerns your state","REGAN"
"Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you","REGAN"
"That to our sister you do make return.","REGAN"
"Say you have wronged her.","REGAN"
"  Ask her forgiveness?","LEAR"
"Do you but mark how this becomes the house:","LEAR"
"Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.
Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.","LEAR"
"Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks.","REGAN"
"Return you to my sister.","REGAN"
",   Never, Regan.","LEAR"
"She hath abated me of half my train,","LEAR"
"Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue","LEAR"
"Most serpentlike upon the very heart.","LEAR"
"All the stored vengeances of heaven fall","LEAR"
"On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,","LEAR"
"You taking airs, with lameness!","LEAR"
"  Fie, sir, fie!","CORNWALL"
"You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames","LEAR"
"Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,","LEAR"
"You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun","LEAR"
"To fall and blister!","LEAR"
"O, the blest gods! So will you wish on me","REGAN"
"When the rash mood is on.","REGAN"
"No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.","LEAR"
"Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give","LEAR"
"Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but","LEAR"
"thine","LEAR"
"Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee","LEAR"
"To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,","LEAR"
"To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,","LEAR"
"And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt","LEAR"
"Against my coming in. Thou better know'st","LEAR"
"The offices of nature, bond of childhood,","LEAR"
"Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.","LEAR"
"Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,","LEAR"
"Wherein I thee endowed.","LEAR"
"  Good sir, to th' purpose.","REGAN"
"Who put my man i' th' stocks?","LEAR"
"  What trumpet's that?","CORNWALL"
"I know 't--my sister's. This approves her letter,","REGAN"
"That she would soon be here.","REGAN"
"Is your lady come?","REGAN"
"This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride","LEAR"
"Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.--","LEAR"
"Out, varlet, from my sight!","LEAR"
"  What means your Grace?","CORNWALL"
"Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope","LEAR"
"Thou didst not know on 't.","LEAR"
"Who comes here? O heavens,","LEAR"
"If you do love old men, if your sweet sway","LEAR"
"Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,","LEAR"
"Make it your cause. Send down and take my part.","LEAR"
" Art not ashamed to look upon this","LEAR"
"O Regan, will you take her by the hand?","LEAR"
"Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?","GONERIL"
"All's not offense that indiscretion finds","GONERIL"
"And dotage terms so.","GONERIL"
"  O sides, you are too tough!","LEAR"
"Will you yet hold?--How came my man i' th'","LEAR"
"stocks?","LEAR"
"I set him there, sir, but his own disorders","CORNWALL"
"Deserved much less advancement.","CORNWALL"
"  You? Did you?","LEAR"
"I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.","REGAN"
"If till the expiration of your month","REGAN"
"You will return and sojourn with my sister,","REGAN"
"Dismissing half your train, come then to me.","REGAN"
"I am now from home and out of that provision","REGAN"
"Which shall be needful for your entertainment.","REGAN"
"Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?","LEAR"
"No! Rather I abjure all roofs, and choose","LEAR"
"To wage against the enmity o' th' air,","LEAR"
"To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,","LEAR"
"Necessity's sharp pinch. Return with her?","LEAR"
"Why the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took","LEAR"
"Our youngest born--I could as well be brought","LEAR"
"To knee his throne and, squire-like, pension beg","LEAR"
"To keep base life afoot. Return with her?","LEAR"
"Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter","LEAR"
"To this detested groom.	","LEAR"
"  At your choice, sir.","GONERIL"
"I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.","LEAR"
"I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell.","LEAR"
"We'll no more meet, no more see one another.","LEAR"
"But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter,","LEAR"
"Or, rather, a disease that's in my flesh,","LEAR"
"Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,","LEAR"
"A plague-sore or embossed carbuncle","LEAR"
"In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.","LEAR"
"Let shame come when it will; I do not call it.","LEAR"
"I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,","LEAR"
"Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.","LEAR"
"Mend when thou canst. Be better at thy leisure.","LEAR"
"I can be patient. I can stay with Regan,","LEAR"
"I and my hundred knights.","LEAR"
"  Not altogether so.","REGAN"
"I looked not for you yet, nor am provided","REGAN"
"For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,","REGAN"
"For those that mingle reason with your passion","REGAN"
"Must be content to think you old, and so--","REGAN"
"But she knows what she does.","REGAN"
"  Is this well spoken?","LEAR"
"I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?","REGAN"
"Is it not well? What should you need of more?","REGAN"
"Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger","REGAN"
"Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house","REGAN"
"Should many people under two commands","REGAN"
"Hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible.","REGAN"
"Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance","GONERIL"
"From those that she calls servants, or from mine?","GONERIL"
"Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack","REGAN"
"you,","REGAN"
"We could control them. If you will come to me","REGAN"
"(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you","REGAN"
"To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more","REGAN"
"Will I give place or notice.","REGAN"
"  I gave you all--","LEAR"
"  And in good time you gave it.","REGAN"
"Made you my guardians, my depositaries,","LEAR"
"But kept a reservation to be followed","LEAR"
"With such a number. What, must I come to you","LEAR"
"With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?","LEAR"
"And speak 't again, my lord. No more with me.","REGAN"
"Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favored","LEAR"
"When others are more wicked. Not being the worst","LEAR"
"Stands in some rank of praise.  I'll go","LEAR"
"with thee.","LEAR"
"Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,","LEAR"
"And thou art twice her love.","LEAR"
"  Hear me, my lord.","GONERIL"
"What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,","GONERIL"
"To follow in a house where twice so many","GONERIL"
"Have a command to tend you?","GONERIL"
"  What need one?","REGAN"
"O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars","LEAR"
"Are in the poorest thing superfluous.","LEAR"
"Allow not nature more than nature needs,","LEAR"
"Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;","LEAR"
"If only to go warm were gorgeous,","LEAR"
"Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,","LEAR"
"Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true","LEAR"
"need--","LEAR"
"You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!","LEAR"
"You see me here, you gods, a poor old man","LEAR"
"As full of grief as age, wretched in both.","LEAR"
"If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts","LEAR"
"Against their father, fool me not so much","LEAR"
"To bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger,","LEAR"
"And let not women's weapons, water drops,","LEAR"
"Stain my man's cheeks.--No, you unnatural hags,","LEAR"
"I will have such revenges on you both","LEAR"
"That all the world shall--I will do such things--","LEAR"
"What they are yet I know not, but they shall be","LEAR"
"The terrors of the Earth! You think I'll weep.","LEAR"
"No, I'll not weep.","LEAR"
"I have full cause of weeping, but this heart","LEAR"
"Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws","LEAR"
"Or ere I'll weep.--O Fool, I shall go mad!","LEAR"
"  Let us withdraw. 'Twill be a storm.","CORNWALL"
"This house is little. The old man and 's people","REGAN"
"Cannot be well bestowed.","REGAN"
"'Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest,","GONERIL"
"And must needs taste his folly.","GONERIL"
"For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,","REGAN"
"But not one follower.","REGAN"
"So am I purposed. Where is my lord of Gloucester?","GONERIL"
"Followed the old man forth.","CORNWALL"
"He is returned.","CORNWALL"
"  The King is in high rage.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Whither is he going?","CORNWALL"
"He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.","GLOUCESTER"
"'Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.","CORNWALL"
", ","GONERIL"
"My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.","GONERIL"
"Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds","GLOUCESTER"
"Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about","GLOUCESTER"
"There's scarce a bush.","GLOUCESTER"
"  O sir, to willful men","REGAN"
"The injuries that they themselves procure","REGAN"
"Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.","REGAN"
"He is attended with a desperate train,","REGAN"
"And what they may incense him to, being apt","REGAN"
"To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.","REGAN"
"Shut up your doors, my lord. 'Tis a wild night.","CORNWALL"
"My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.","CORNWALL"
"  Who's there, besides foul weather?","KENT"
"One minded like the weather, most unquietly.","GENTLEMAN"
"  I know you. Where's the King?","KENT"
"Contending with the fretful elements;","GENTLEMAN"
"Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea","GENTLEMAN"
"Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,","GENTLEMAN"
"That things might change or cease; tears his white","GENTLEMAN"
"hair,","GENTLEMAN"
"Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage","GENTLEMAN"
"Catch in their fury and make nothing of;","GENTLEMAN"
"Strives in his little world of man to outscorn","GENTLEMAN"
"The to-and-fro conflicting wind and rain.","GENTLEMAN"
"This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would","GENTLEMAN"
"couch,","GENTLEMAN"
"The lion and the belly-pinched wolf","GENTLEMAN"
"Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs","GENTLEMAN"
"And bids what will take all.","GENTLEMAN"
"  But who is with him?","KENT"
"None but the Fool, who labors to outjest","GENTLEMAN"
"His heart-struck injuries.","GENTLEMAN"
"  Sir, I do know you","KENT"
"And dare upon the warrant of my note","KENT"
"Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,","KENT"
"Although as yet the face of it is covered","KENT"
"With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall,","KENT"
"Who have--as who have not, that their great stars","KENT"
"Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,","KENT"
"Which are to France the spies and speculations","KENT"
"Intelligent of our state. From France there comes","KENT"
"a power","KENT"
"Into this scattered kingdom, who already,","KENT"
"Wise in our negligence, have secret feet","KENT"
"In some of our best ports and are at point","KENT"
"To show their open banner. Now to you:","KENT"
"If on my credit you dare build so far","KENT"
"To make your speed to Dover, you shall find","KENT"
"Some that will thank you, making just report","KENT"
"Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow","KENT"
"The King hath cause to plain: what hath been seen,","KENT"
"Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,","KENT"
"Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne","KENT"
"Against the old kind king, or something deeper,","KENT"
"Whereof perchance these are but furnishings.","KENT"
"I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,","KENT"
"And from some knowledge and assurance offer","KENT"
"This office to you.","KENT"
"I will talk further with you.","GENTLEMAN"
"  No, do not.","KENT"
"For confirmation that I am much more","KENT"
"Than my outwall, open this purse and take","KENT"
"What it contains.","KENT"
"If you shall see Cordelia","KENT"
"(As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,","KENT"
"And she will tell you who that fellow is","KENT"
"That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!","KENT"
"I will go seek the King.","KENT"
"Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?","GENTLEMAN"
"Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:","KENT"
"That when we have found the King--in which your","KENT"
"pain","KENT"
"That way, I'll this--he that first lights on him","KENT"
"Holla the other.","KENT"
"Blow winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!","LEAR"
"You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout","LEAR"
"Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the","LEAR"

"You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,","LEAR"
"Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,","LEAR"
"Singe my white head. And thou, all-shaking","LEAR"
"thunder,","LEAR"
"Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world.","LEAR"
"Crack nature's molds, all germens spill at once","LEAR"
"That makes ingrateful man.","LEAR"
"  O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is","FOOL"
"better than this rainwater out o' door. Good nuncle,","FOOL"
"in. Ask thy daughters' blessing. Here's a night","FOOL"
"pities neither wise men nor fools.","FOOL"
"Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!","LEAR"
"Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.","LEAR"
"I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.","LEAR"
"I never gave you kingdom, called you children;","LEAR"
"You owe me no subscription. Then let fall","LEAR"
"Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,","LEAR"
"A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.","LEAR"
"But yet I call you servile ministers,","LEAR"
"That will with two pernicious daughters join","LEAR"
"Your high-engendered battles 'gainst a head","LEAR"
"So old and white as this. O, ho, 'tis foul!","LEAR"
"  He that has a house to put 's head in has a good","FOOL"
"headpiece.","FOOL"
"	The codpiece that will house","FOOL"
"	   Before the head has any,","FOOL"

"	   So beggars marry many.","FOOL"
"	The man that makes his toe","FOOL"
"	   What he his heart should make,","FOOL"
"	Shall of a corn cry woe,","FOOL"
"	   And turn his sleep to wake.","FOOL"
"For there was never yet fair woman but she made","FOOL"
"mouths in a glass.","FOOL"
"No, I will be the pattern of all patience.","LEAR"
"I will say nothing.","LEAR"
"  Who's there?","KENT"
"  Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a","FOOL"
"wise man and a fool.","FOOL"
"Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night","KENT"
"Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies","KENT"
"Gallow the very wanderers of the dark","KENT"
"And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,","KENT"
"Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,","KENT"
"Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never","KENT"
"Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry","KENT"
"Th' affliction nor the fear.","KENT"
"  Let the great gods","LEAR"

"Unwhipped of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,","LEAR"
"Thou perjured, and thou simular of virtue","LEAR"
"That art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,","LEAR"
"That under covert and convenient seeming","LEAR"
"Has practiced on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,","LEAR"
"Rive your concealing continents and cry","LEAR"
"These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man","LEAR"
"More sinned against than sinning.","LEAR"
"  Alack,","KENT"
"bareheaded?","KENT"
"Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel.","KENT"
"Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.","KENT"

"I am cold myself.--Where is this straw, my fellow?","LEAR"

"True, my good boy.--Come, bring us to this hovel.","LEAR"
"  This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll","FOOL"

"	When priests are more in word than matter,","FOOL"
"	When brewers mar their malt with water,","FOOL"
"	When nobles are their tailors' tutors,","FOOL"
"	No heretics burned but wenches' suitors,","FOOL"
"	When every case in law is right,","FOOL"
"	No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;","FOOL"
"	When slanders do not live in tongues,","FOOL"
"	Nor cutpurses come not to throngs,","FOOL"
"	When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,","FOOL"
"	And bawds and whores do churches build,","FOOL"

"	Come to great confusion;","FOOL"
"	Then comes the time, who lives to see 't,","FOOL"
"	That going shall be used with feet.","FOOL"
"This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before","FOOL"
"his time.","FOOL"
"  Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this","GLOUCESTER"
"unnatural dealing. When I desired their leave that I","GLOUCESTER"
"might pity him, they took from me the use of mine","GLOUCESTER"
"own house, charged me on pain of perpetual","GLOUCESTER"
"displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for","GLOUCESTER"
"him, or any way sustain him.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Most savage and unnatural.","EDMUND"
"  Go to; say you nothing. There is division","GLOUCESTER"
"between the dukes, and a worse matter than that. I","GLOUCESTER"
"have received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to","GLOUCESTER"
"be spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet.","GLOUCESTER"
"These injuries the King now bears will be revenged","GLOUCESTER"
"home; there is part of a power already footed. We","GLOUCESTER"
"must incline to the King. I will look him and privily","GLOUCESTER"
"relieve him. Go you and maintain talk with the","GLOUCESTER"
"Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he","GLOUCESTER"
"ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as","GLOUCESTER"
"no less is threatened me, the King my old master","GLOUCESTER"
"must be relieved. There is strange things toward,","GLOUCESTER"
"Edmund. Pray you, be careful.	","GLOUCESTER"
"This courtesy forbid thee shall the Duke","EDMUND"
"Instantly know, and of that letter too.","EDMUND"
"This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me","EDMUND"
"That which my father loses--no less than all.","EDMUND"
"The younger rises when the old doth fall.","EDMUND"
"Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.","KENT"
"The tyranny of the open night 's too rough","KENT"
"For nature to endure.	","KENT"
"  Let me alone.","LEAR"
"Good my lord, enter here.","KENT"
"  Wilt break my heart?","LEAR"
"I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.","KENT"
"Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm","LEAR"
"Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee.","LEAR"
"But where the greater malady is fixed,","LEAR"
"The lesser is scarce felt. Thou 'dst shun a bear,","LEAR"
"But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,","LEAR"
"Thou 'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the","LEAR"
"mind's free,","LEAR"
"The body's delicate. This tempest in my mind","LEAR"
"Doth from my senses take all feeling else","LEAR"
"Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!","LEAR"
"Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand","LEAR"
"For lifting food to 't? But I will punish home.","LEAR"
"No, I will weep no more. In such a night","LEAR"
"To shut me out? Pour on. I will endure.","LEAR"
"In such a night as this? O Regan, Goneril,","LEAR"
"Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all!","LEAR"
"O, that way madness lies. Let me shun that;","LEAR"
"No more of that.","LEAR"
"  Good my lord, enter here.","KENT"
"Prithee, go in thyself. Seek thine own ease.","LEAR"
"This tempest will not give me leave to ponder","LEAR"
"On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.--","LEAR"
"In, boy; go first.--You houseless poverty--","LEAR"
"Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.","LEAR"
"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,","LEAR"

"How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,","LEAR"
"Your looped and windowed raggedness defend","LEAR"
"you","LEAR"
"From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en","LEAR"
"Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp.","LEAR"

"Now, where's your master?","GONERIL"
"Madam, within, but never man so changed.","OSWALD"
"I told him of the army that was landed;","OSWALD"
"He smiled at it. I told him you were coming;","OSWALD"
"His answer was ""The worse."" Of Gloucester's","OSWALD"
"treachery","OSWALD"
"And of the loyal service of his son","OSWALD"
"When I informed him, then he called me ""sot""","OSWALD"
"And told me I had turned the wrong side out.","OSWALD"
"What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;","OSWALD"
"What like, offensive.","OSWALD"
",   Then shall you go no further.","GONERIL"
"It is the cowish terror of his spirit,","GONERIL"
"That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs","GONERIL"
"Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way","GONERIL"
"May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.","GONERIL"
"Hasten his musters and conduct his powers.","GONERIL"
"I must change names at home and give the distaff","GONERIL"
"Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant","GONERIL"
"Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to","GONERIL"
"hear--","GONERIL"
"If you dare venture in your own behalf--","GONERIL"
"A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech.","GONERIL"
"Decline your head.  This kiss, if it","GONERIL"
"durst speak,","GONERIL"
"Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.","GONERIL"
"Conceive, and fare thee well.","GONERIL"
"Yours in the ranks of death.	","EDMUND"
"  My most dear","GONERIL"
"Gloucester!","GONERIL"
"O, the difference of man and man!","GONERIL"
"To thee a woman's services are due;","GONERIL"
"My fool usurps my body.","GONERIL"
"  Madam, here comes my lord.	","OSWALD"
"I have been worth the whistle.","GONERIL"
"  O Goneril,","ALBANY"
"You are not worth the dust which the rude wind","ALBANY"
"Blows in your face. I fear your disposition.","ALBANY"
"That nature which contemns its origin","ALBANY"
"Cannot be bordered certain in itself.","ALBANY"
"She that herself will sliver and disbranch","ALBANY"
"From her material sap perforce must wither","ALBANY"
"And come to deadly use.","ALBANY"
"  No more. The text is foolish.","GONERIL"
"Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.","ALBANY"
"Filths savor but themselves. What have you done?","ALBANY"
"Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?","ALBANY"
"A father, and a gracious aged man,","ALBANY"
"Whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would","ALBANY"
"lick,","ALBANY"
"Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you","ALBANY"
"madded.","ALBANY"
"Could my good brother suffer you to do it?","ALBANY"
"A man, a prince, by him so benefited!","ALBANY"
"If that the heavens do not their visible spirits","ALBANY"
"Send quickly down to tame these vile offenses,","ALBANY"
"It will come:","ALBANY"
"Humanity must perforce prey on itself,","ALBANY"
"Like monsters of the deep.","ALBANY"
"  Milk-livered man,","GONERIL"
"That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;","GONERIL"
"Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning","GONERIL"
"Thine honor from thy suffering; that not know'st","GONERIL"
"Fools do those villains pity who are punished","GONERIL"
"Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy","GONERIL"
"drum?","GONERIL"
"France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,","GONERIL"
"With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,","GONERIL"
"Whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries","GONERIL"
"Alack, why does he so?","GONERIL"
"  See thyself, devil!","ALBANY"
"Proper deformity shows not in the fiend","ALBANY"
"So horrid as in woman.","ALBANY"
"  O vain fool!","GONERIL"
"Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame","ALBANY"
"Bemonster not thy feature. Were 't my fitness","ALBANY"
"To let these hands obey my blood,","ALBANY"
"They are apt enough to dislocate and tear","ALBANY"
"Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,","ALBANY"
"A woman's shape doth shield thee.","ALBANY"
"  Marry, your manhood, mew--","GONERIL"
"  What news?","ALBANY"
"O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead,","MESSENGER"
"Slain by his servant, going to put out","MESSENGER"
"The other eye of Gloucester.","MESSENGER"
"  Gloucester's eyes?","ALBANY"
"A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,","MESSENGER"
"Opposed against the act, bending his sword","MESSENGER"
"To his great master, who, thereat enraged,","MESSENGER"
"Flew on him and amongst them felled him dead,","MESSENGER"
"But not without that harmful stroke which since","MESSENGER"
"Hath plucked him after.","MESSENGER"
"  This shows you are above,","ALBANY"
"You justicers, that these our nether crimes","ALBANY"
"So speedily can venge. But, O poor Gloucester,","ALBANY"
"Lost he his other eye?","ALBANY"
"  Both, both, my lord.--","MESSENGER"
"This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.","MESSENGER"
"'Tis from your sister.","MESSENGER"
",   One way I like this well.","GONERIL"
"But being widow and my Gloucester with her","GONERIL"
"May all the building in my fancy pluck","GONERIL"
"Upon my hateful life. Another way","GONERIL"
"The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.","GONERIL"
"Where was his son when they did take his eyes?","ALBANY"
"Come with my lady hither.","MESSENGER"
"  He is not here.","ALBANY"
"No, my good lord. I met him back again.","MESSENGER"
"  Knows he the wickedness?","ALBANY"
"Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he informed against him","MESSENGER"
"And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment","MESSENGER"
"Might have the freer course.","MESSENGER"
"  Gloucester, I live","ALBANY"
"To thank thee for the love thou show'd'st the King,","ALBANY"
"And to revenge thine eyes.--Come hither, friend.","ALBANY"
"Tell me what more thou know'st.","ALBANY"
"  Why the King of France is so suddenly gone","KENT"
"back know you no reason?","KENT"
"  Something he left imperfect in the state,","GENTLEMAN"
"which since his coming forth is thought of, which","GENTLEMAN"
"imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger","GENTLEMAN"
"that his personal return was most required and","GENTLEMAN"
"necessary.","GENTLEMAN"
"  Who hath he left behind him general?","KENT"
"  The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.","GENTLEMAN"
"  Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration","KENT"
"of grief?","KENT"
"Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my","GENTLEMAN"
"presence,","GENTLEMAN"
"And now and then an ample tear trilled down","GENTLEMAN"
"Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen","GENTLEMAN"
"Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,","GENTLEMAN"
"Fought to be king o'er her.","GENTLEMAN"
"  O, then it moved her.","KENT"
"Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove","GENTLEMAN"
"Who should express her goodliest. You have seen","GENTLEMAN"
"Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears","GENTLEMAN"
"Were like a better way. Those happy smilets","GENTLEMAN"
"That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know","GENTLEMAN"
"What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence","GENTLEMAN"
"As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,","GENTLEMAN"
"Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved","GENTLEMAN"
"If all could so become it.","GENTLEMAN"
"  Made she no verbal question?","KENT"
"Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of","GENTLEMAN"
"father","GENTLEMAN"
"Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart;","GENTLEMAN"
"Cried ""Sisters, sisters, shame of ladies, sisters!","GENTLEMAN"
"Kent, father, sisters! What, i' th' storm, i' th' night?","GENTLEMAN"
"Let pity not be believed!"" There she shook","GENTLEMAN"
"The holy water from her heavenly eyes,","GENTLEMAN"
"And clamor moistened. Then away she started,","GENTLEMAN"
"To deal with grief alone.","GENTLEMAN"
"  It is the stars.","KENT"
"The stars above us govern our conditions,","KENT"
"Else one self mate and make could not beget","KENT"
"Such different issues. You spoke not with her","KENT"
"since?","KENT"
"  No.","GENTLEMAN"
"Was this before the King returned?","KENT"
"  No, since.","GENTLEMAN"
"Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town,","KENT"
"Who sometime in his better tune remembers","KENT"
"What we are come about, and by no means","KENT"
"Will yield to see his daughter.","KENT"
"  Why, good sir?","GENTLEMAN"
"A sovereign shame so elbows him--his own","KENT"
"unkindness,","KENT"
"That stripped her from his benediction, turned her","KENT"
"To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights","KENT"
"To his dog-hearted daughters--these things sting","KENT"
"His mind so venomously that burning shame","KENT"
"Detains him from Cordelia.","KENT"
"  Alack, poor gentleman!","GENTLEMAN"
"Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?","KENT"
"  'Tis so. They are afoot.","GENTLEMAN"
"Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear","KENT"
"And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause","KENT"
"Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.","KENT"
"When I am known aright, you shall not grieve","KENT"
"Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go","KENT"
"Along with me.","KENT"
"Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now","CORDELIA"
"As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud,","CORDELIA"
"Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,","CORDELIA"
"With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckooflowers,","CORDELIA"
"Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow","CORDELIA"
"In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.","CORDELIA"
"Search every acre in the high-grown field","CORDELIA"
"And bring him to our eye.	","CORDELIA"
"What can man's wisdom","CORDELIA"
"In the restoring his bereaved sense?","CORDELIA"
"He that helps him take all my outward worth.","CORDELIA"
"  There is means, madam.","DOCTOR"
"Our foster nurse of nature is repose,","DOCTOR"
"The which he lacks. That to provoke in him","DOCTOR"
"Are many simples operative, whose power","DOCTOR"
"Will close the eye of anguish.","DOCTOR"
"  All blest secrets,","CORDELIA"
"All you unpublished virtues of the earth,","CORDELIA"
"Spring with my tears. Be aidant and remediate","CORDELIA"
"In the good man's distress. Seek, seek for him,","CORDELIA"
"Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life","CORDELIA"
"That wants the means to lead it.","CORDELIA"
"  News, madam.","MESSENGER"
"The British powers are marching hitherward.","MESSENGER"
"'Tis known before. Our preparation stands","CORDELIA"
"In expectation of them.--O dear father,","CORDELIA"
"It is thy business that I go about.","CORDELIA"
"Therefore great France","CORDELIA"
"My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.","CORDELIA"
"No blown ambition doth our arms incite,","CORDELIA"
"But love, dear love, and our aged father's right.","CORDELIA"
"Soon may I hear and see him.","CORDELIA"
"But are my brother's powers set forth?","REGAN"
"  Ay, madam.","OSWALD"
"  Himself in person there?","REGAN"
"  Madam, with much ado.","OSWALD"
"Your sister is the better soldier.","OSWALD"
"Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?","REGAN"
"  No, madam.","OSWALD"
"What might import my sister's letter to him?","REGAN"
"  I know not, lady.","OSWALD"
"Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.","REGAN"
"It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,","REGAN"
"To let him live. Where he arrives he moves","REGAN"
"All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,","REGAN"
"In pity of his misery, to dispatch","REGAN"
"His nighted life; moreover to descry","REGAN"
"The strength o' th' enemy.","REGAN"
"I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.","OSWALD"
"Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us.","REGAN"
"The ways are dangerous.","REGAN"
"  I may not, madam.","OSWALD"
"My lady charged my duty in this business.","OSWALD"
"Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you","REGAN"
"Transport her purposes by word? Belike,","REGAN"
"Some things--I know not what. I'll love thee much--","REGAN"
"Let me unseal the letter.","REGAN"
"  Madam, I had rather--","OSWALD"
"I know your lady does not love her husband;","REGAN"
"I am sure of that; and at her late being here,","REGAN"
"She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks","REGAN"
"To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.","REGAN"
"  I, madam?","OSWALD"
"I speak in understanding. Y' are; I know 't.","REGAN"
"Therefore I do advise you take this note:","REGAN"
"My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked,","REGAN"
"And more convenient is he for my hand","REGAN"
"Than for your lady's. You may gather more.","REGAN"
"If you do find him, pray you, give him this,","REGAN"
"And when your mistress hears thus much from you,","REGAN"
"I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.","REGAN"
"So, fare you well.","REGAN"
"If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,","REGAN"
"Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.","REGAN"
"Would I could meet him, madam. I should show","OSWALD"
"What party I do follow.","OSWALD"
"  Fare thee well.","REGAN"
"When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?","GLOUCESTER"
"You do climb up it now. Look how we labor.","EDGAR"
"Methinks the ground is even.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Horrible steep.","EDGAR"
"Hark, do you hear the sea?","EDGAR"
"  No, truly.","GLOUCESTER"
"Why then, your other senses grow imperfect","EDGAR"
"By your eyes' anguish.","EDGAR"
"  So may it be indeed.","GLOUCESTER"
"Methinks thy voice is altered and thou speak'st","GLOUCESTER"
"In better phrase and matter than thou didst.","GLOUCESTER"
"You're much deceived; in nothing am I changed","EDGAR"
"But in my garments.","EDGAR"
"  Methinks you're better spoken.","GLOUCESTER"
"Come on, sir. Here's the place. Stand still. How","EDGAR"
"fearful","EDGAR"
"And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!","EDGAR"
"The crows and choughs that wing the midway air","EDGAR"
"Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down","EDGAR"
"Hangs one that gathers samphire--dreadful trade;","EDGAR"
"Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.","EDGAR"
"The fishermen that walk upon the beach","EDGAR"
"Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark","EDGAR"
"Diminished to her cock, her cock a buoy","EDGAR"
"Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge","EDGAR"
"That on th' unnumbered idle pebble chafes","EDGAR"
"Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more","EDGAR"
"Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight","EDGAR"
"Topple down headlong.","EDGAR"
"  Set me where you stand.","GLOUCESTER"
"Give me your hand. You are now within a foot","EDGAR"
"Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon","EDGAR"
"Would I not leap upright.","EDGAR"
"  Let go my hand.","GLOUCESTER"
"Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel","GLOUCESTER"
"Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods","GLOUCESTER"
"Prosper it with thee.	","GLOUCESTER"
"Go thou further off.","GLOUCESTER"
"Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.","GLOUCESTER"
", ","EDGAR"
"Now fare you well, good sir.","EDGAR"
"  With all my heart.","GLOUCESTER"
", ","EDGAR"
"Why I do trifle thus with his despair","EDGAR"
"Is done to cure it.","EDGAR"
"  O you mighty gods!	","GLOUCESTER"
"This world I do renounce, and in your sights","GLOUCESTER"
"Shake patiently my great affliction off.","GLOUCESTER"
"If I could bear it longer, and not fall","GLOUCESTER"
"To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,","GLOUCESTER"
"My snuff and loathed part of nature should","GLOUCESTER"
"Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!--","GLOUCESTER"
"Now, fellow, fare thee well.	","GLOUCESTER"
"  Gone, sir. Farewell.--","EDGAR"
"And yet I know not how conceit may rob","EDGAR"
"The treasury of life, when life itself","EDGAR"
"Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,","EDGAR"
"By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?--","EDGAR"
"Ho you, sir! Friend, hear you. Sir, speak.--","EDGAR"
"Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.--","EDGAR"
"What are you, sir?","EDGAR"
"  Away, and let me die.","GLOUCESTER"
"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,","EDGAR"
"So many fathom down precipitating,","EDGAR"
"Thou 'dst shivered like an egg; but thou dost","EDGAR"
"breathe,","EDGAR"
"Hast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art","EDGAR"
"sound.","EDGAR"
"Ten masts at each make not the altitude","EDGAR"
"Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.","EDGAR"
"Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.","EDGAR"
"  But have I fall'n or no?","GLOUCESTER"
"From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.","EDGAR"
"Look up a-height. The shrill-gorged lark so far","EDGAR"
"Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.","EDGAR"
"  Alack, I have no eyes.","GLOUCESTER"
"Is wretchedness deprived that benefit","GLOUCESTER"
"To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort","GLOUCESTER"
"When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage","GLOUCESTER"
"And frustrate his proud will.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Give me your arm.","EDGAR"
"Up. So, how is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.","EDGAR"
"Too well, too well.","GLOUCESTER"
"  This is above all strangeness.","EDGAR"
"Upon the crown o' th' cliff, what thing was that","EDGAR"
"Which parted from you?","EDGAR"
"  A poor unfortunate beggar.","GLOUCESTER"
"As I stood here below, methought his eyes","EDGAR"
"Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,","EDGAR"
"Horns whelked and waved like the enraged sea.","EDGAR"
"It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,","EDGAR"
"Think that the clearest gods, who make them","EDGAR"
"honors","EDGAR"
"Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.","EDGAR"
"I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear","GLOUCESTER"
"Affliction till it do cry out itself","GLOUCESTER"
"Enough, enough! and die. That thing you speak of,","GLOUCESTER"
"I took it for a man. Often 'twould say","GLOUCESTER"
"The fiend, the fiend! He led me to that place.","GLOUCESTER"
"Bear free and patient thoughts.","EDGAR"
"But who comes here?","EDGAR"
"The safer sense will ne'er accommodate","EDGAR"
"His master thus.","EDGAR"
"  No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the","LEAR"
"King himself.","LEAR"
"  O, thou side-piercing sight!","EDGAR"
"  Nature's above art in that respect. There's your","LEAR"
"press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a","LEAR"
"crowkeeper. Draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look,","LEAR"
"a mouse! Peace, peace! This piece of toasted cheese","LEAR"
"will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a","LEAR"
"giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!","LEAR"
"I' th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.","LEAR"
"  Sweet marjoram.","EDGAR"
"  Pass.","LEAR"
"  I know that voice.","GLOUCESTER"
"  Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flattered","LEAR"
"me like a dog and told me I had the white hairs in","LEAR"
"my beard ere the black ones were there. To say ""ay""","LEAR"
"and ""no"" to everything that I said ""ay"" and ""no"" to","LEAR"
"was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me","LEAR"
"once and the wind to make me chatter, when the","LEAR"
"thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I","LEAR"
"found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to. They are","LEAR"
"not men o' their words; they told me I was everything.","LEAR"
"'Tis a lie. I am not ague-proof.","LEAR"
"The trick of that voice I do well remember.","GLOUCESTER"
"Is 't not the King?","GLOUCESTER"
"  Ay, every inch a king.","LEAR"
"When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.","LEAR"
"I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?","LEAR"
"Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.","LEAR"
"The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly does","LEAR"
"lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for","LEAR"
"Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father","LEAR"
"than my daughters got 'tween the lawful sheets. To","LEAR"
"'t, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers. Behold yond","LEAR"

"presages snow, that minces virtue and does shake","LEAR"
"the head to hear of pleasure's name. The fitchew","LEAR"
"nor the soiled horse goes to 't with a more riotous","LEAR"
"appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs,","LEAR"

"  Th' hast spoken right. 'Tis true.","EDMUND"
"The wheel is come full circle; I am here.","EDMUND"
", ","ALBANY"
"Methought thy very gait did prophesy","ALBANY"
"A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.","ALBANY"
"Let sorrow split my heart if ever I","ALBANY"
"Did hate thee or thy father!","ALBANY"
"  Worthy prince, I know 't.","EDGAR"
"  Where have you hid yourself?","ALBANY"
"How have you known the miseries of your father?","ALBANY"
"By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale,","EDGAR"
"And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!","EDGAR"
"The bloody proclamation to escape","EDGAR"
"That followed me so near--O, our lives' sweetness,","EDGAR"
"That we the pain of death would hourly die","EDGAR"
"Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift","EDGAR"
"Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance","EDGAR"
"That very dogs disdained, and in this habit","EDGAR"
"Met I my father with his bleeding rings,","EDGAR"
"Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,","EDGAR"
"Led him, begged for him, saved him from despair.","EDGAR"
"Never--O fault!--revealed myself unto him","EDGAR"
"Until some half hour past, when I was armed.","EDGAR"
"Not sure, though hoping of this good success,","EDGAR"
"I asked his blessing, and from first to last","EDGAR"
"Told him our pilgrimage. But his flawed heart","EDGAR"
"(Alack, too weak the conflict to support)","EDGAR"
"'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,","EDGAR"
"Burst smilingly.","EDGAR"
"  This speech of yours hath moved me,","EDMUND"
"And shall perchance do good. But speak you on.","EDMUND"
"You look as you had something more to say.","EDMUND"
"If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,","ALBANY"
"For I am almost ready to dissolve,","ALBANY"
"Hearing of this.","ALBANY"
"  This would have seemed a period","EDGAR"
"To such as love not sorrow; but another,","EDGAR"
"To amplify too much, would make much more","EDGAR"
"And top extremity. Whilst I","EDGAR"
"Was big in clamor, came there in a man","EDGAR"
"Who, having seen me in my worst estate,","EDGAR"
"Shunned my abhorred society; but then, finding","EDGAR"
"Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms","EDGAR"
"He fastened on my neck and bellowed out","EDGAR"
"As he'd burst heaven, threw him on my father,","EDGAR"
"Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him","EDGAR"
"That ever ear received, which, in recounting,","EDGAR"
"His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life","EDGAR"
"Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,","EDGAR"
"And there I left him tranced.","EDGAR"
"  But who was this?","ALBANY"
"Kent, sir, the banished Kent, who in disguise","EDGAR"
"Followed his enemy king and did him service","EDGAR"
"Improper for a slave.","EDGAR"
"Help, help, O, help!","GENTLEMAN"
"  What kind of help?","EDGAR"
",   Speak, man!","ALBANY"
"  What means this bloody knife?","EDGAR"
"'Tis hot, it smokes! It came even from the heart","GENTLEMAN"
"Of--O, she's dead!","GENTLEMAN"
"  Who dead? Speak, man.","ALBANY"
"Your lady, sir, your lady. And her sister","GENTLEMAN"
"By her is poisoned. She confesses it.","GENTLEMAN"
"I was contracted to them both. All three","EDMUND"
"Now marry in an instant.","EDMUND"
"  Here comes Kent.","EDGAR"
", ","ALBANY"
"Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead.","ALBANY"
"This judgment of the heavens, that makes us","ALBANY"
"tremble,","ALBANY"
"Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?","ALBANY"
" The time will not allow the compliment","ALBANY"
"Which very manners urges.","ALBANY"
"  I am come","KENT"
"To bid my king and master aye goodnight.","KENT"
"Is he not here?","KENT"
"  Great thing of us forgot!","ALBANY"
"Speak, Edmund, where's the King? And where's","ALBANY"
"Cordelia?","ALBANY"
"Seest thou this object, Kent?","ALBANY"
"  Alack, why thus?","KENT"
"  Yet Edmund was beloved.","EDMUND"
"The one the other poisoned for my sake,","EDMUND"
"And after slew herself.","EDMUND"
"  Even so.--Cover their faces.","ALBANY"
"I pant for life. Some good I mean to do","EDMUND"
"Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send--","EDMUND"
"Be brief in it--to th' castle, for my writ","EDMUND"
"Is on the life of Lear, and on Cordelia.","EDMUND"
"Nay, send in time.","EDMUND"
"  Run, run, O, run!","ALBANY"
"To who, my lord?  Who has the office?","EDGAR"
"Send","EDGAR"
"Thy token of reprieve.","EDGAR"
"Well thought on. Take my sword. Give it the","EDMUND"
"Captain.","EDMUND"
",   Haste thee for thy life.","EDGAR"
", ","EDMUND"
"He hath commission from thy wife and me","EDMUND"
"To hang Cordelia in the prison, and","EDMUND"
"To lay the blame upon her own despair,","EDMUND"
"That she fordid herself.","EDMUND"
"The gods defend her!--Bear him hence awhile.","ALBANY"
"Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!","LEAR"
"Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so","LEAR"
"That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone","LEAR"
"forever.","LEAR"
"I know when one is dead and when one lives.","LEAR"
"She's dead as earth.--Lend me a looking glass.","LEAR"
"If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,","LEAR"
"Why, then she lives.","LEAR"
"  Is this the promised end?","KENT"
"Or image of that horror?","EDGAR"
"  Fall and cease.","ALBANY"
"This feather stirs. She lives. If it be so,","LEAR"
"It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows","LEAR"
"That ever I have felt.","LEAR"
"  O, my good master--","KENT"
"Prithee, away.","LEAR"
"  'Tis noble Kent, your friend.","EDGAR"
"A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!","LEAR"
"I might have saved her. Now she's gone forever.--","LEAR"
"Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!","LEAR"
"What is 't thou sayst?--Her voice was ever soft,","LEAR"
"Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.","LEAR"
"I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.","LEAR"
"'Tis true, my lords, he did.","GENTLEMAN"
"  Did I not, fellow?","LEAR"
"I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion","LEAR"
"I would have made him skip. I am old now,","LEAR"
"And these same crosses spoil me.  Who","LEAR"
"are you?","LEAR"
"Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.","LEAR"
"If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated,","KENT"
"One of them we behold.","KENT"
"This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?","LEAR"
"  The same,","KENT"
"Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?","KENT"
"He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.","LEAR"
"He'll strike and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.","LEAR"
"No, my good lord, I am the very man--","KENT"
"  I'll see that straight.","LEAR"
"That from your first of difference and decay","KENT"
"Have followed your sad steps.","KENT"
"  You are welcome","LEAR"
"hither.","LEAR"
"Nor no man else. All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.","KENT"
"Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,","KENT"
"And desperately are dead.","KENT"
"  Ay, so I think.","LEAR"
"He knows not what he says, and vain is it","ALBANY"
"That we present us to him.","ALBANY"
"  Very bootless.","EDGAR"
"  Edmund is dead, my lord.","MESSENGER"
"  That's but a trifle here.--","ALBANY"
"You lords and noble friends, know our intent:","ALBANY"
"What comfort to this great decay may come","ALBANY"
"Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,","ALBANY"
"During the life of this old Majesty,","ALBANY"
"To him our absolute power; you to your rights,","ALBANY"
"With boot and such addition as your Honors","ALBANY"
"Have more than merited. All friends shall taste","ALBANY"
"The wages of their virtue, and all foes","ALBANY"
"The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!","ALBANY"
"And my poor fool is hanged. No, no, no life?","LEAR"
"Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,","LEAR"
"And thou no breath at all? Thou 'lt come no more,","LEAR"
"Never, never, never, never, never.--","LEAR"
"Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.","LEAR"
"Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,","LEAR"
"Look there, look there!	","LEAR"
"  He faints.  My lord,","EDGAR"
"my lord!","EDGAR"
"Break, heart, I prithee, break!","KENT"
"  Look up, my lord.","EDGAR"
"Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him","KENT"
"That would upon the rack of this tough world","KENT"
"Stretch him out longer.","KENT"
"  He is gone indeed.","EDGAR"
"The wonder is he hath endured so long.","KENT"
"He but usurped his life.","KENT"
"Bear them from hence. Our present business","ALBANY"
"Is general woe.  Friends of my","ALBANY"
"soul, you twain","ALBANY"
"Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.","ALBANY"
"I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;","KENT"
"My master calls me. I must not say no.","KENT"
"The weight of this sad time we must obey,","EDGAR"
"Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.","EDGAR"
"The oldest hath borne most; we that are young","EDGAR"
"Shall never see so much nor live so long.","EDGAR"
